I am a master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering concentrating on Applied Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. I am strongly interested in AI's applications in healthcare, language technologies, and the environment. I am now taking a short course at [ESIIL](https://esiil.org).
